Building a simple HTML webpage as part of The Odin Project

A webpage created fully utilising the simple building blocks of HTML. The main idea is to be familiarised with the HTML5 boilerplate: DOCTYPE declaration, html element, head element for webpage metadata (charset, title, viewport settings), body element where visual elements (heading elements, img, anchor) resides.

The different heading elements (h1-h6) are demonstrated, along with the different attributes required for anchor and img elements (href/src, alt). The use of absolute and relative links to display images and redirect links are included as well, as part of the aim of applying what was learnt in the basics of HTML in The Odin Project
