            <ul style="margin-top:0px;">
                <li>4 salted egg yolks</li>
                <li>3 tbsp butter</li>
                <li>1-2 Thai bird's eye chili deseeded and finely chopped, optional</li>
                <li>1-2 tsp sugar</li>
                <li>10-15 curry leaves or Thai basil</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Cooking Instructions</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Separate the salted egg yolks from the whites. Steam the yolks over high heat for 10 minutes until cooked through, then crumble with a fork until very fine. Set aside.</li>
                <li>Marinate the chicken: whisk together the egg white with 1 tablespoon cornstarch until light and frothy. Add the chicken, soy sauce, and shaoxing wine and let marinate for 15 minutes.</li>
                <li>Place a rack over a rimmed baking sheet lined with paper towels. Heat 2 inches of oil in a high-sided, heavy bottomed pot over medium high heat until oil reaches 350Â°F.</li>
                <li>Scoop the chicken out of the marinade and toss in the remaining cornstarch. Use a pair of tongs to gently add the chicken to the hot oil in batches, being careful not to crowd the pan. Cook until golden brown, crispy, and cooked through, about 3-4 minutes, flipping as needed. Drain the chicken on your prepared rack and keep warm in the oven.</li>
                <li>When all the chicken is cooked and keeping warm in the oven, make the sauce: In a frying pan, melt the butter over very low heat. Add the mashed salted egg yolks to the butter and cook until it starts to foam up.</li>
                <li>Stir in the chili, sugar, and basil/curry leaves. Add the chicken and toss to coat evenly and enjoy immediately!
